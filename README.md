# FIT5032-A1 : TeamUp

TeamUp is a community-focused platform that promotes health and well-being through participation in sports, particularly for underrepresented individuals and those with physical or mental challenges. Users can discover, join, or create activities tailored to their needs, while visual maps and filtering tools make event access easy and intuitive. The platform also supports community contributions through donations for sports equipment and encourages sustained engagement with gamified rewards, creating a fun, inclusive, and supportive environment for everyone.
